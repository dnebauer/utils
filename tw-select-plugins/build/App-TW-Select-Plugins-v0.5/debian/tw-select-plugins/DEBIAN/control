Description: interactive filter for selecting plugins
 In client-server TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com/ plugins are referred to
 by the subdirectory path to plugin files within a plugins directory. The
 customary practice is to use two levels of subdirectory:
 PLUGIN_AUTHOR/PLUGIN_NAME.
 .
 This script is an interactive filter that accepts a newline-separated list of
 enabled plugins via standard input. The user is then presented with a list
 box containing all plugins in the specified plugins directories (the method
 of plugins directory selection is discussed in /Plugins directory selection
 below). The plugins provided via standard input are pre-selected. The user
 can select additional plugins and deselect currently enabled plugins. When
 the user presses the Set! button a newline-separated list of selected plugins
 is sent to standard output.
