NAME

    App::Dn::FontViewer2 - view font appearance

VERSION

    This documentation applies to App::Dn::FontViewer2 version 0.1.

SYNOPSIS

      use App::Dn::FontViewer2;
      App::Dn::FontViewer2->new_with_options->run;

DESCRIPTION

    Invokes a font viewer that enables the user to view the effect of
    changing the following font attributes:

      * family

      * size

      * bolding

      * italicising

      * underlining

      * overstriking (aka strikethough).

    but noting that at the time of writing the underlining and overstriking
    attributes have no effect on font appearance.

    Two widgets are displayed: an empty MainWindow and a Tk::FontDialog.
    The font dialog is closed by pressing the OK or Cancel buttons. The
    main window is closed by pressing the Escape or q keys.

    The class part of the X11 WM_CLASS property for the displayed main
    window is set to "Perl/Tk widget". For the font dialog the X11 WM_CLASS
    property is set to "FontDialog" while the WM_INSTANCE property is set
    to "fontdialog".

    For a viewer that does not use a pre-defined font dialog see the
    dn-font-viewer app.

    When the font viewer is dismissed, the attributes of the last viewed
    font are printed to stdout.
