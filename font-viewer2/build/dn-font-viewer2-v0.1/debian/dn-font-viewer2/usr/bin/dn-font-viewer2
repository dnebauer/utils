=head1 NAME

dn-font-viewer2 - view font appearance

=head1 USAGE

B<dn-font-viewer2>

B<dn-font-viewer2 -h>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Invokes a font viewer that enables the user to view the effect of changing the
following font attributes:

=over

=item *

family

=item *

size

=item *

bolding

=item *

italicising

=item *

underlining

=item *

overstriking (aka strikethough).

=back

but noting that at the time of writing the underlining and overstriking
attributes have no effect on font appearance.

Two widgets are displayed: an empty MainWindow and a Tk::FontDialog.
The font dialog is closed by pressing the C<OK> or C<Cancel> buttons.
The main window is closed by pressing the C<Escape> or C<q> keys.

The class part of the X11 WM_CLASS property for the displayed main window is
set to "Perl/Tk widget".
For the font dialog the X11 WM_CLASS property is set to "FontDialog" while the
WM_INSTANCE property is set to "fontdialog".

For a viewer that does not use a pre-defined font dialog see the
S<< F<dn-font-viewer> >> app.

When the font viewer is dismissed, the attributes of the last viewed font are
printed to stdout.
