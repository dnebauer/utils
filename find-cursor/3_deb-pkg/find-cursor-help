find-cursor highlights the cursor position by drawing circles around it.
https://github.com/arp242/find-cursor

Flags:
  -h, --help          Show this help.

Shape options:
  -s, --size          Maximum size the circle will grow to in pixels.
  -d, --distance      Distance between the circles in pixels.
  -l, --line-width    Width of the lines in pixels.
  -w, --wait          Time to wait before drawing the next circle in
                      tenths of milliseconds.
  -c, --color         Color as X11 color name or RGB (e.g. #ff0000)
  -g, --grow          Grow the animation in size, rather than shrinking it.

Extra options:
  -f, --follow        Follow the cursor position as the cursor is moving.
  -t, --transparent   Make the window truly 'transparent'. This helps with
                      some display issues when following the cursor position,
                      but it doesn't work well with all WMs, which is why
                      it's disabled by default.
  -o, --outline       Width in pixels of outline; uses 2px if no value is given.
                      Helps visibility on all backgrounds.
  -O, --outline-color Color of outline; if omitted it will automatically use
                      the opposite color. No effect if -o isn't set.
  -r, --repeat        Number of times to repeat the animation; use 0 to repeat
                      indefinitely.

Examples:
  The defaults:
    ./find-cursor --size 320 --distance 40 --wait 400 --line-width 4 --color black

  Draw a solid circle:
    ./find-cursor --size 100 --distance 1 --wait 20 --line-width 1

  Always draw a full circle on top of the cursor:
    ./find-cursor --repeat 0 --follow --distance 1 --wait 1 --line-width 16 --size 16

Launching:
  You will want to map a key in your window manager to run find-cursor.
  You can also use xbindkeys, which should work with any window manager.

  I run it with xcape:
       xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape;Shift_L=KP_Add'

  When Left Shift is tapped a Keypad Add is sent; I configured my window
  manager to launch find-cursor with that.

  I don't have a numpad on my keyboard; you can also use F13 or some
  other unused key.
