NAME

    App::Dn::PerlModuleDebianPackage - find debian package providing perl
    module

VERSION

    This documantation is for App::Dn::PerlModuleDebianPackage version 0.9.

SYNOPSIS

        use App::Dn::PerlModuleDebianPackage;
    
        App::Dn::PerlModuleDebianPackage->new_with_script->run;

DESCRIPTION

    Finds the file loaded when a specified module is loaded, and finds the
    debian package providing that file.

    It may be necessary to provide additional module names. See the notes
    for the --additional_modules option for more details.

    The debian package name is also copied to the system clipboard unless
    this is suppressed by the --no_copy option. On X-windows systems such
    as linux there are three selections (the term for copied or cut text):
    primary, secondary and clipboard. This script copies the package name
    to the primary and clipboard selections. These selections are pasted
    using the middle mouse button and ctrl+v keys, respectively. In
    terminals it may be necessary to paste with shift key + middle mouse
    button, and shift+ctrl+v keys, respectively.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

 Arguments

  module

    The perl module to analyse. String. Required.

 Options

  -a | --additional_modules MODULE ...

    Additional perl module(s) required to run perl command that discovers
    module file.

    To specify multiple additional modules:

      * Use the -a option for each additional module, or

      * Provide multiple modules to -a as a comma-delimited string (with no
      spaces), or

      * A combination of both approaches.

    The need for an additional module may suggested by an error message
    when running the script. For example, when analysing module
    MooX::Options the script returns the following error message:

        Can't find the method <with> in <main> ! Ensure to load a Role::Tiny \
        compatible module like Moo or Moose before using MooX::Options.\
        at -e line 0.

    While the message is somewhat opaque, it is clearly asking for Moo or
    Moose. Providing either of these as an additional module results in
    successful execution.

  -n | --no_copy

    Do not copy the debian package name to the clipboard. Flag. Optional.
    Default: false.

  -h | --help

    Display help and exit. Flag. Optional. Default: false.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 run()

    This is the only public method. It finds the debian package providing a
    perl module, as described in "DESCRIPTION".

DIAGNOSTICS

 Can't find the method <with> in <main> ! Ensure to load ...

    While the message is somewhat opaque, it is clearly asking for Moo or
    Moose. Providing either of these as an additional module results in
    successful execution.
