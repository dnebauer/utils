wkhtmltopdf-static README
=========================

wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage are command line tools to
render HTML into PDF and various image formats using the
QT Webkit rendering engine. These run entirely "headless"
and do not require a display or display service.

This package has been built by downloading the wkhtmltopdf
source from https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf and
built using the instructions at https://github.com/\
wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/blob/master/INSTALL.md

The generic build instructions were followed to produce 64-
bit binaries on an amd64 system.
