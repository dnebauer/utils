.TH "dn-mc-conf" "1" "2012-06-17" "" "Dn-mc-conf Manual"
.SH "NAME"
\*[self] \- regenerate local mc configuration files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.BR "\*[self] "
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Midnight Commander (mc) is a file browser.  Much of its power comes from its ability to configure how to open, view and perform operations on different file types.
.SS Extension files
Configuration of how to open and view different file types is done via 'extension files'.  These files contain entries based on file extensions, file types and mime types.  When a file is opened or viewed the extension file is searched for a matching entry and the first match is used.
.PP
Determining which extension file to use is a little unwieldy.  There is a global extension file,
.IR "\*[ext_file_global]" ", "
which is used by default.  If a local extension file,
.IR "\*[ext_file_local]" ", "
is present then it is used instead of the global file, and the global extension file is
.B not
used.  There is no way to call the global extension file from the local one.  In fact, there is
.B no
way to call both local and global extension files.
.PP
The only way to maintain a local extension file without the overhead of tracking changes in the package's global extension file is to keep local changes in a 'changes' file and periodically regenerate the local extension file by concatenating the 'changes' file and the global extension file as saving the result as the local extension file.
.SS Menu files
Midnight Commander also has a user-configurable menu system controlled by 'menu files'. These configuration files determine the options in the user menu (F2). As with extension files, there is a global menu file,
.IR "\*[menu_file_global]" ", "
which is used by default.  A local menu file,
.IR "\*[menu_file_local]" ", "
will be used if present and there is no way for it to call the global menu file. As with extension files, local menu items are kept in a local 'changes' and the local menu file is periodically regenerated by concatenating the 'changes' file and global menu file.
.SS 'Changes' files
This package provides local 'changes' files for extensions,
.IR "\*[ext_file_pkg]" ", "
and menu items,
.IR "\*[menu_file_pkg]" ", "
and a daily cron script,
.IR "\*[cron_script]" ", "
that regenerates local mc extension and menu files. The cron script writes feedback to the system log.
.PP
The script
.I \*[self]
is a wrapper for the daily cron script enabling it to be called directly.
.SS External virtual filesystems (extfs)
Midnight Commander has a number of virtual file systems (vfs), including an ftp file system (ftpfs) and its own network-based file system (mcfs). Another vfs is the EXTernal virtual FileSystem (extfs) designed to handle numerous file and file system types in Midnight Commander by including scripts. The extfs is particularly useful for handling archive filesystems like deb and zip.
.PP
The extfs script for rar archives included with Midnight Commander,
.IR "\*[rar_extfs_default]" ", "
is broken. It uses syntax incompatible with the free version of rar. Also, the free version of rar cannot handle some rar archives.
.PP
This package provides a custom rar script,
.IR "\*[rar_extfs_custom]" ", "
which utilises p7zip's rar module for extracting files from rar archives and uses rar to delete directories and files. It is unable to successfully create directories in a rar archive or copy files and directories into a rar archive \(en doing so generates an error message.
