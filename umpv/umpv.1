.\" Macro: Format URL

.\" Package: -mwww macro package of web-related functions
.\"  note: -mwww package is part of GNU 'troff'.
.\"        The '.g' register is only found in GNU 'troff'
.\"        and is set to '1' (true).
.\"        The '\n' escape returns the value of a register.
.\"        So, this 'if' command ensures GNU 'troff' is
.\"        running before attempting to load the -mwww

.if \n[.g] .mso www.tmac

.TH "UMPV" "1" "2017-02-09" "" "UMPV Manual"
.SH "NAME"
\*[self] \- emulate 'unique application' functionality for mpv
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.BI "\*[self] " "filename"
.RI "[" "filename ..." "]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\*[self] emulates \(aqunique application\(aq functionality on Linux. When starting
playback with \*[self], it will try to reuse an already running instance of
mpv (but only if that was started with \*[self]). Other mpv instances (not started
by \*[self]) are ignored, and the script doesn't know about them.
.PP
This only takes filenames as arguments. Custom options can't be used; the script
interprets them as filenames. If mpv is already running, the files passed to
\*[self] are appended to mpv's internal playlist. If a file does not exist or is
otherwise not playable, mpv will skip the playlist entry when attempting to
play it (from the GUI perspective, it's silently ignored).
.PP
If mpv isn't running yet, \*[self] will start mpv and let it control the
current terminal. It will not write output to stdout/stderr, because this
will typically just fill ~/.xsession-errors with garbage.
.PP
mpv will terminate if there are no more files to play, and running \*[self]
after that will start a new mpv instance.
.PP
Note that you can control the mpv instance by writing to the command fifo:
.PP
.RS 4
echo "cycle fullscreen" > ~/.umpv_fifo
.RE
.PP
Note: You can supply custom mpv path and options with the MPV environment
variable. The environment variable will be split on whitespace, and the
first item is used as path to mpv binary and the rest is passed as options
.I if
the script starts mpv. If mpv is not started by \*[self], i.e., mpv
is already running, this will be ignored.
.PP
