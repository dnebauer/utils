NAME

    App::Dn::Mp3LibAnalyse - analyse mp3 files recursively

VERSION

    This documentation is for App::Dn::Mp3LibAnalyse version 0.6.

SYNOPSIS

        use App::Dn::Mp3LibAnalyse;
    
        App::Dn::Mp3LibAnalyse->new_with_options->run;

DESCRIPTION

    Search the current directory recursively for subdirectories that
    contain mp3 audio files. For each of those (sub)directories perform an
    analysis determined by the -a option. All subdirectories meeting the
    criteria of the analysis are printed to stdout, one per line.

    If the -l flag is used then feedback is logged to a log file. A file
    path to the log file can be specified with the -f option. If no file
    path is provided, the default log file path
    ~/tmp/dn-mp3-library-analyse.log is used. If the directory component of
    the log file path is not present, the script exits with a fatal error.

    The exact feedback written to the log file depends on the analysis
    performed.

 Analysis: missing_key_tags

    If this analysis is selected each (sub)directory is scanned for mp3
    audio files missing any of the following id3v2 tags: album art (APIC),
    album (TALB), genre (TCON), title (TIT2), artist (TPE1), and track
    (TRCK). Directories meeting this criteria are output to stdout. The
    feedback written to the log file is of the form:

        /full/path/to/directory:
          - d1_01_audio-file-name.mp3
            . album_art, album, artist, genre, title, track
          - d2_11_audio-file-name.mp3
            . genre, track
