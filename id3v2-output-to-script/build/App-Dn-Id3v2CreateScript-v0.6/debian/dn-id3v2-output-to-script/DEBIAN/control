Description: converts id3v2 output to a script
 Convert id3v2 output (created using the --list option) to a bash script. The
 bash script contains an id3v2 command for each mp3 file which sets its tags
 to those present in the initial output. Any id3v1 tag information in the
 input is ignored. The id3v2 output can be provided to this script as stdin
 (default) or as a file. The bash script output produced can be sent to stdout
 (default) or to a file. If output is sent to a file the created file is set
 to executable (permissions 0755).
 .
 This may seem to be a pointless script: when would it ever be necessary to
 set mp3 file tags to the values they already have? One applicable scenario,
 and the impetus for this script, is that on some occasions the id3v2 utility
 is unable to modify existing tags on some mp3 files. In those cases it is
 necessary to remove all tags and set them anew.
