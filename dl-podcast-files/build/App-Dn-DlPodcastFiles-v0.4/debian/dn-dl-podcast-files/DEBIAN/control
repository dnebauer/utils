Description: download podcast files
 App::Dn::DlPodcastFiles was developed for downloading podcast files that are
 too old to appear in a podcast feed but that are still included in the rss
 feed file online. Details of the files are obtained and a yaml import file
 created.
 .
 The import file lists the following for each download file:
 .
 url, title, date, time
 .
 Date and time are the date and time the file was published.
 .
 Required values are url, title and time. Date is optional.
 .
 Here is an example import file. It lists episodes from the "Fear the Boot"
 podcast.
