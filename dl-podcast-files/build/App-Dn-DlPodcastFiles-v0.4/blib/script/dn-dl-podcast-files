=head1 DESCRIPTION

A script developed for downloading podcast files that are too old to appear in
a podcast feed but that are still included in the rss feed file online.

Before running this script details of the podcast files are obtained and a YAML
import file created. The import file lists the following for each download
file:

    url, title, date, time

I<date> and I<time> are the date and time the file was published.

Required values are I<url>, I<title> and I<time>; I<date> is optional.

Here is an example import file. It lists episodes from the "Fear the Boot"
podcast.

    ---
    url: http://media.libsyn.com/media/feartheboot/feartheboot_0001.mp3
    title: Episode 1 - when player abilities eclipse character abilities
    date: 2006-05-15
    time: 2230

    url: http://media.libsyn.com/media/feartheboot/feartheboot_0002.mp3

    title: Episode 3 - character creation
    date: 2006-05-30
    time: 0836

The downloaded file name consists of the url filename with a prefix constructed
from the episode's date and, if provided, time. Here are the download files
corresponding to the import file shown above:

    20060515-2230_feartheboot_0001.mp3
    20060523-0611_feartheboot_0002.mp3
