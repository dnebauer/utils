# Devices
# -------
# label:
# - user designation for device
# - is given as parameter to @pkg@ to identify new default device
# - must not contain any spaces
# - used in udev rules file so this file and it must be kept in synchrony
#   - in debian build systems udev rules file is in debian build directory
#
# alsa name:
# - name given by alsa to audio device
# - to see alsa device names use command
#   'cat /proc/asound/cards'
#   - the device names are on the left in square brackets
# 
# alsa number:
# - card number given by alsa to audio device
# - to see alsa device names use command
#   'aplay -l'
#   - the device names are on the left of the output
# 
# description:
# - user description for device
# - this is used in feedback to users to describe the device
# - you may use the description given by 'cat /proc/asound/cards'
# - use underscores where you would normally use spaces
#   - they will be converted to spaces
#   - there is currently no way to escape underscores to prevent conversion
#
# system default:
# - value is either 'yes' or 'no'
# - set this to 'yes' for the sound device to use when no
#   usb sound devices are plugged in
# - this will usually be the system's sound card
# - only ONE device should be set to 'yes'
#   - if more than one device is set to system default the
#     device selected when a usb sound device is unplugged
#     is unpredictable
#
# set sound:
# - whether to set sound level for device when it is made the default
# - this can be necessary because some devices are set to a low audio
#   level when set as default

## The utility 'amixer' is used to set device sound level.                  ##
##                                                                          ##
## The command used to set sound level is:                                  ##
##   amixer -c <number> set <control> <level> unmute >/dev/null 2>&1        ##
##                                                                          ##
## The alsa device (card) number is needed to cater for cases where asound  ##
## configurations specify device by card number rather than alsa name.  In  ##
## those cases the amixer command fails unless the card number is           ##
## explicitly provided.                                                     ##
##                                                                          ##
## The value for <control> depends on your system.  You can see the         ##
## controls available with the command 'amixer scontrols'.  Note, however,  ##
## that you can usually use 'Master' as the <control> parameter.            ##
##                                                                          ##
## The <level> setting depends on your system settings and user preference. ##
## See the amixer man page for full details on suitable values to use.      ##
## The commonest ones are a percentage (e.g., '100%') or decibel level      ##
## (e.g., '-12.5dB').                                                       ##
