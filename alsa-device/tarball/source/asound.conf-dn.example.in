# example alsa configuration file

# Either alsa device names or card/device numbers can be used to
# specify audio device.  Some applications, such as mplayer,
# cannot handle device names and require card/device numbers.
#
# Alsa device names can be obtained by examining the output
# of the command:
# 		cat /proc/asound/cards
# Device names are in the square brackets on the left of the output.
#
# Alsa device card/device numbers can be obtained by examining the
# output of the command:
# 		aplay -l
#
# In the settings below, replace '<name>' with the device name,
# or replace both <card_number> and <device_number>.

# Using alsa name
pcm.!default {
    type hw
    card <name>
}
ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card <name>
}

# OR

# Using card and device numbers
pcm.!default {
    type hw
    card <card_number>
    device <device_number>
}
ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card <card_number>
    device <device_number>
}
