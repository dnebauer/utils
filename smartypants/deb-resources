control-description smartypants is a free web publishing plug-in for Movable
control-description Type, Blosxom, and BBEdit that easily translates plain
control-description ASCII punctuation characters into “smart” typographic
control-description punctuation HTML entities.
control-description .
control-description smartypants can perform the following transformations:
control-description straight quotes ( " and ' ) into “curly” HTML entities,
control-description backticks-style quotes (``, '') into “curly” HTML entities,
control-description dashes (“--” and “---”) into en- and em-dash entities, and
control-description three consecutive dots (“...”) into an ellipsis entity
control-description .
control-description This means you can write, edit, and save your posts using
control-description plain old ASCII straight quotes, plain dashes, and plain
control-description dots, but your published posts (and final HTML output) will
control-description appear with smart quotes, em-dashes, and proper ellipses.
control-description .
control-description smartypants is a combination plug-in — a single plug-in
control-description file that works with Movable Type, Blosxom, and BBEdit.
control-description It can also be used from a Unix-style command-line.
control-description .
control-description smartypants does not modify characters within <pre>,
control-description <code>, <kbd>, or <script> tag blocks. Typically, these
control-description tags are used to display text where smart quotes and other
control-description “smart punctuation” would not be appropriate, such as
control-description source code or example markup.
