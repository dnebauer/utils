NAME
    texdepend - Find dependencies for a LaTeX file

SYNOPSIS
    texdepend [-help] [-expand] [-format *format-spec*] [-ignore *list*] [-
    out *outfile*] [-print *flags*] [-styles *list*] [-verbose] *file*[.tex]

DESCRIPTION
    texdepend reads a .tex file, and (recursively) all \input{} and
    \include{} files referenced therein, collecting the names of .tex, .sty,
    .bib, .eps files as it goes. If the .log and .aux file for the same
    file.tex file exist in the current directory, texdepend also reads
    these, and parses names of included dependent files.

    It creates the following lists. Only files which actually exist are
    included.

    @includes
        from \input{} and \include{} commands in the .tex file and its
        desendents.

    @packages
        the names of all style and class files from \usepackage{},
        \documentclass{} and \documentstyle{} commands in the preamble of
        the main .tex file.

    @figs
        the names of all graphics files from \includegraphics{} commands in
        the .tex file.

    @styles
        the full path names of *all* style/tex/cfg files used directly or
        indirectly, found in the .log file (except those config'd in @ignore
        or specifed with the -ignore option).

    @bibfiles
        the full path names of .bib files found in the .aux file as
        \bibdata{} files

    @depends
        the full path names of all files found in the .log and .aux files
        (which includes everything in all lists except @figs).

    By default, the program uses kpsewhich (if an executable exists) from
    the teTeX/kpathsea distribution to locate tex/bst/sty files before
    trying the various $TEXINPUTS, $BIBINPUTS, and $TEXFMTS paths, to
    determine the full path names of input files. You may need to change the
    $KPSEWHICH path in the configuration section of texdepend
