control-description texdepend reads a .tex file, and (recursively) all \input{} and
control-description \include{} files referenced therein, collecting the names of .tex, .sty,
control-description bib, .eps files as it goes. If the .log and .aux file for the same
control-description file.tex file exists in the current directory, texdepend also reads
control-description these, and parses names of included dependent files.
control-description .
control-description It creates the following lists. Only files which actually exist are
control-description included.
control-description .
control-description @includes
control-description     from \input{} and \include{} commands in the .tex file and its
control-description     descendents.
control-description .
control-description @packages
control-description     the names of all style and class files from \usepackage{},
control-description     \documentclass{} and \documentstyle{} commands in the preamble of
control-description     the main .tex file.
control-description .
control-description @figs
control-description     the names of all graphics files from \includegraphics{} commands in
control-description     the .tex file.
control-description .
control-description @styles
control-description     the full path names of *all* style/tex/cfg files used directly or
control-description     indirectly, found in the .log file (except those config'd in @ignore
control-description     or specifed with the -ignore option).
control-description .
control-description @bibfiles
control-description     the full path names of .bib files found in the .aux file as
control-description     \bibdata{} files
control-description .
control-description @depends
control-description     the full path names of all files found in the .log and .aux files
control-description     (which includes everything in all lists except @figs).
control-description .
control-description By default, the program uses kpsewhich (if an executable exists) from
control-description the teTeX/kpathsea distribution to locate tex/bst/sty files before
control-description trying the various $TEXINPUTS, $BIBINPUTS, and $TEXFMTS paths, to
control-description determine the full path names of input files. You may need to change the
control-description $KPSEWHICH path in the configuration section of texdepend.
