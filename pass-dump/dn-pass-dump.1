.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This script accesses password information stored by
Pass <https://www.passwordstore.org/>, "the standard unix password manager",
and dumps (writes) it to an output file. The output format can be plain text or
markdown.
.SS "Pass configuration"
.IX Subsection "Pass configuration"
The script accesses all password files stored in the password file tree. It
does this one at a time. It is not possible for the user to enter their
password for accessing these files because all console output is being
captured. For that reason the script initially accesses just one password file
without capturing the output, i.e., the user is able to enter the password for
this file. Pass must be configured to stay authenticated for a few minutes;
this can be done using
gpg-agent <https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/>.
.SS "Output format"
.IX Subsection "Output format"
The output file has a header which includes a title, author and date of
writing. The file has a footer which states 'END OF FILE'.
.PP
In between the header and footer is a section for each password file, listed
alphabetically and with a horizontal line between them.
.PP
Here is the layout for each password section:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    url
\&
\&    password
\&
\&    field_1: value_1
\&    field_2: value_2
\&    etc.
.Ve
.PP
In markdown-formatted output:
.IP \(bu 4
The url is a second-level header.
.IP \(bu 4
The password is placed within a code fence.
.IP \(bu 4
Values which include a '/' or '\e' can cause fatal errors during pdf generation.
For this reason any values containing either of these characters are enclosed
in backticks to ensure they are rendered as code spans. (This prevents their
interference with pdf production.) Unfortunately, most pdf generation processes
do not wrap code spans, so if they are long these values may extend beyond the
pdf page edge.
.IP \(bu 4
Lines whose values do \fInot\fR include '\e' or '/' will be split across multiple
lines if they are more than 70 characters long. Split lines have a four-space
hanging indent.
.PP
In text output the password and field lines are indented by two spaces. There
is no line splitting as occurs with markdown output.
