=head1 NAME

dn-font-viewer - view font appearance

=head1 USAGE

B<dn-font-viewer>

B<dn-font-viewer -h>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Invokes a font viewer that enables the user to view the effect of changing the
following font attributes:

=over

=item *

family

=item *

size

=item *

bolding

=item *

italicising

=item *

underlining

=item *

overstriking (aka strikethough).

=back

but noting that at the time of writing the underlining and overstriking
attributes have no effect on font appearance.

The font viewer is closed by pressing the C<Escape> key.

The viewer interface is constructed directly inside a top level widget.
The class part of the X11 WM_CLASS property for the displayed widget is set to
"Perl/Tk widget".
For a viewer that uses a pre-defined font dialog see the
S<< F<dn-font-viewer2> >> app.

When the font viewer is dismissed, the attributes of the last viewed font are
printed to stdout.
