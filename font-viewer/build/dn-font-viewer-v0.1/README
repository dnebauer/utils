VERSION

    This documentation applies to App::Dn::FontViewer version 0.1.

SYNOPSIS

      use App::Dn::FontViewer;
      App::Dn::FontViewer->new_with_options->run;

DESCRIPTION

    Invokes a font viewer that enables the user to view the effect of
    changing the following font attributes:

      * family

      * size

      * bolding

      * italicising

      * underlining

      * overstriking (aka strikethough).

    but noting that at the time of writing the underlining and overstriking
    attributes have no effect on font appearance.

    The font viewer is closed by pressing the Escape key.

    The viewer interface is constructed directly inside a top level widget.
    The class part of the X11 WM_CLASS property for the displayed widget is
    set to "Perl/Tk widget". For a viewer that uses a pre-defined font
    dialog see the dn-font-viewer2 app.

    When the font viewer is dismissed, the sttributes of the last viewed
    font are printed to stdout.
