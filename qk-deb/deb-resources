control-description This script takes files and packages them into a deb.
control-description It will package script, manpage, data, icon, desktop
control-description and configuration files. Only script and manpage files
control-description are required. (Note: a manpage file is not required
control-description for a perl script -- the manpage file is generated
control-description from perlscript pod.)
control-description .
control-description By default all the package files created by the build
control-description process will be saved: deb, diff.gz, dsc and orig.tar.gz.
control-description Neither source package nor .changes file will be
control-description cryptographically signed. Use of the '-d' option will
control-description result in only the deb file being saved.
control-description .
control-description For a script library package the requirements for script
control-description and manpages files are relaxed -- specify the library
control-description scripts as data files. They will be installed to
control-description pkgdatadir, e.g., on Debian systems /usr/share/foo/.
