=head1 NAME

App::Dn::QkDeb::Path - supply provided and true paths

=head1 VERSION

This is documentation for App::Dn::QkDeb::Path version 0.8.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # ...
    elsif ($type eq 'extra') {
      my $qkdeb = App::Dn::QkDeb::Path->new(path => $path);
      $self->_add_extra_path($qkdeb);
    }
    # ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package was introduced to handle directory names in order to solve a
problem: the parent module (L<App::Dn::QkDeb>) uses the real ("true") path of
a directory which, in the case of symlinks, may have a different directory name
to the original (symlink) directory. This matters for the project paths
because, while it is the real directories that are copied to the build
directory, they must retain their original names.

When creating an object the directory is supplied (attribute 'dir'). It is
coerced into an absolute path which is stored internally as a
L<Path::Tiny> object.

This package enables the original directory names (method C<name>) and real
paths (method C<real>) to be retrieved.
