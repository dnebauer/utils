Shellharden: The corrective bash syntax highlighter.

Usage:
	shellharden [options] [files]
	cat files | shellharden [options] ''

Shellharden is a syntax highlighter and a tool to semi-automate the rewriting
of scripts to ShellCheck conformance, mainly focused on quoting.

The default mode of operation is like `cat`, but with syntax highlighting in
foreground colors and suggestive changes in background colors.

Options:
	--suggest         Output a colored diff suggesting changes.
	--syntax          Output syntax highlighting with ANSI colors.
	--syntax-suggest  Diff with syntax highlighting (default mode).
	--transform       Output suggested changes.
	--check           No output; exit with 2 if changes are suggested.
	--replace         Replace file contents with suggested changes.
	--                Don't treat further arguments as options.
	-h|--help         Show help text.
	--version         Show version.

The changes suggested by Shellharden inhibits word splitting and indirect
pathname expansion. This will make your script ShellCheck compliant in terms of
quoting. Whether your script will work afterwards is a different question:
If your script was using those features on purpose, it obviously won't anymore!

Every script is possible to write without using word splitting or indirect
pathname expansion, but it may involve doing things differently.
