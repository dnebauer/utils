.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Used to store details of festival events (or, indeed, events for any multi-day event). The script was originally developed for recording details of various events at the Royal Sydney Easter Show.

.SS "Event details"
.IX Subsection "Event details"
Each event is assumed to begin and end during a single day.
.PP
For each event the following details are recorded:
.RS 4
.IP \fIDate\fR 4
.IX Item "Date"
The day on which the event occurs.
.Sp
It is assumed all events start and finish within a single day, that is, there are no events spread over multiple days.
.Sp
For each event the user is presented with a list of dates for which events have already been defined. The most recently used date will be pre-selected. If the user wants to use a new date they simply exit the menu.
.Sp
ISO format. Required.
.IP "\fIStart time\fR" 4
.IX Item "Start time"
Time the event begins.
.Sp
The time can be in 'HHMM' format, in which leading zeroes must be entered, or 'HH:MM' format, in which leading zeroes can be dropped.
.Sp
Optional.
.IP "\fIEnd time\fR" 4
.IX Item "End time"

.Sp
Required.
.IP \fILocation\fR 4
.IX Item "Location"
Location at which event is held.
.Sp
The user is provided with assistance to enter the event location. If the event name has been entered previously, the user is presented with a list of locations at which that event has previously been held. If the most recently entered location is in that list, it is pre-selected. If the user exits that menu without selecting a location, they are then presented with a list of \fIall\fR previously entered locations (if there are any). If the user exits that menu without selecting a location, they are able to enter the location manually.
.Sp
Required.

On exiting data is saved to a persistent data store (default: \fIfestival.data\fR) if data has been added or edited. When the script is next run the data is loaded from that data store. Note that a different file name can be used (see the \fI\-s\fR option).
.PP
Entered event details can be edited and entire events can be deleted.
