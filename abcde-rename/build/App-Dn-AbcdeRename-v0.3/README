NAME

    App::Dn::AbcdeRename - rename abcde output files

VERSION

    This documentation applies to App::Dn::AbcdeRename version 0.3.

SYNOPSIS

      App::Dn::AbcdeRename->new(artist => $artist)->rename;

DESCRIPTION

    The utility abcde rips cds to disc with each track output to an mp3
    file. The default output file naming format produces files named like:

              01.Song_Name.mp3

    App::Dn::AbcdeRename provides the rename method which attempts to
    rename all mp3 files in the current directory to:

              artist-name_track-number_song-name.mp3

    Note conversion to lowercase. All characters that are not
    alphanumerics, spaces or dashes are removed.

    A fatal error occurs if any mp3 file in the current directory is not
    named according to the default abcde output format.

    The artist name must be provided during object instantiation.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 rename()

    Renames all mp3 files in the current directory from naming format:

              01.Song_Name.mp3

    to naming format:

              artist-name_track-number_song-name.mp3

    See "DESCRIPTION" for further details.

DIAGNOSTICS

 No mp3 files

    Occurs when there are no mp3 files in the current directory. Fatal
    error.

 No artist found

    Was a valid value passed to the artist property at object
    instantiation? Fatal error.

 Could not extract name =head2 Could not extract number =head2 Error
 extracting name and number from file name 'FILE' =head2 Unable to convert
 'FILE' =head2 Unable to convert artist 'ARTIST' =head2 Unable to convert
 track name part 'NAME' of file name 'FILE'

    These errors are triggered by problems converting a mp3 file to the
    format:

              artist-name_track-number_song-name.mp3

    Perhaps it was not named according to the default abcde output file
    format? Fatal errors.

 Cannot have empty file name

    This occurs when the user is editing file names and sets a file name to
    an empty string. Fatal error.

 Failed renaming 'FILE' to 'FILE': ERROR" =head2 Invalid file 'FILE'

    These warnings indicate problems with the renaming operation, possibly
    a system error. Non-fatal warnings.

 Did not get both artist and file =head2 No file name pairs =head2 No files
 in reference =head2 No files reference provided =head2 Not an arrayref

    These are internal programming error messages. If one of them occurs it
    indicates a logic error in the module that needs to be fixed. Please
    report the error to the module maintainer. Fatal errors.

INCOMPATIBILITIES

    None known.
