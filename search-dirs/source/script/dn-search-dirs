=head1 NAME

dn-search-dirs - repeatedly search a set of directories

=head1 USAGE

B<dn-search-dirs> [B<-l>] [B<-e>] [B<e>]

B<dn-search-dirs -h>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list of directories is kept in a configuration file
(F<~/.config/dn-search-dirs/dir-list>) that can be listed on screen (option
C<-l>) and edited (option C<-e>).

When run without an option the user is prompted for a file name fragment. All
configured directories are then searched for matching files. Note that these
directory searches are not recursive. When the search is complete a total match
count and all matching file paths are displayed. The user is then prompted for
another file name fragment.

To exit the user presses enter without entering a search fragment, i.e., an
empty search string.
