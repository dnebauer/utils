NAME

    App::Dn::SearchDirs - repeatedly search a set of directories

VERSION

    This documentation is for App::Dn::SearchDirs version 0.5.

SYNOPSIS

        use App::Dn::SearchDirs;
    
        App::Dn::SearchDirs->new_with_options->run;

DESCRIPTION

    A list of directories is kept in a configuration file
    (~/.config/dn-search-dirs/dir-list) that can be listed on screen
    (option -l) and edited (option -e).

    When run without an option the user is prompted for a file name
    fragment. All configured directories are then searched for matching
    files. Note that these directory searches are not recursive. When the
    search is complete a total match count and all matching file paths are
    displayed. The user is then prompted for another file name fragment.

    To exit the user presses enter without entering a search fragment,
    i.e., an empty search string.
